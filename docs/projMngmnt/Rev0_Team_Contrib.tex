\section{Demo Plans}

For revision 0  we plan to show a minimum viable product for \progname. This would involve showcasing the main 3 features of the housemates application: the bill management functionality, the scheduling functionality, and the task management functionality. Specifically, for the bill management function we will show a bill split between a group of users, for the scheduling functionality we will showcase the creation of an event, and for the task management functionality we will showcase the creation of a task for a group.
