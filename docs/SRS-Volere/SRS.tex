\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}

With the ongoing affordable housing shortage in Canada many people have been forced to find roommates in order to have a place to live in. This is especially common at universities like McMaster where its extremely common to have housemates while in student housing. While having roommates may help ease financial pressures it can lead to a lot of stress in dealing with them. These stresses can include things like dealing with splitting household tasks and grocery costs. An application that helps deal with these common stresses in the roommate life would make it more convenient  for the housemates to live together and overall simplify their lives.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{6cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Goals} & \textbf{Importance}\\
\hline The application will have a straightforward and user-friendly interface that is simple to use for all users, regardless of technical ability. & This allows first time users to be interested in our product and a good experience with the overall product. \\
\hline
The application will simplify household task management through a task management system. & This allows streamlining the allocation of chores which in return will reduce conflicts and misunderstandings between housemates. \\
\hline
The application will streamline expense sharing through a cost management system. & This makes it possible for roommates to monitor their expenditure and prevent overspending. Additionally, it encourages each person to make a fair financial contribution. \\
\hline
The application will have a scheduling system that will allow for users to schedule quiet hours & This allows users to focus on their work, sleep, or studies without any interruption. \\
\hline
The application will have a calendar to see scheduled events & This allows users to coordinate their schedules and help them in managing their time in a better way. \\

\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client}

N/A

\subsection{Customer}

\begin{itemize}
    \item People with housemates: People with housemates are the primary stakeholders of this application. They can use the application to better simplify life with housemates. As such they will have the greatest influence out of the stakeholders on the requirements of the application during the development process.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other Stakeholders}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Landlords / Property Manager / Housing Association: Landlords would be a secondary stakeholder for the application. Landlords might be interested in using an application like this for their tenants so that they will better be able to communicate with them with respects to household tasks that are required. As such, they might play a minor role on determining the requirements of the application during the design process.
  \item Families: Families can also benefit from the app to have a centralized place for all household matters. They can distribute chores evenly and keep track of bills. It promotes talking openly and encourages users to be more responsible about household duties and bills.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}

\begin{itemize}
    \item People with housemates
    \item Landlords / Property Manager / Housing Association
    \item Families
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Personas}
Andrew is a student at McMaster University. He lives off-campus in student housing with four other housemates. He and his roommates have to buy groceries and supplies for the house. They also have to do various household chores and pay for utilities and internet. Sometimes Andrew and his roommates have trouble communicating with one another on this. Additionally, Andrew gets annoyed when his roommates decide to have a party the day before Andrew has an exam.

\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}

The primary stakeholders for this project are people with housemates and as such they will have the highest priority during the development process. The other stakeholders will be considered during the development process, but overall will have a lower priority.

\subsection{User Participation}

During the development process we plan to test the application with the stakeholders described above. Their feedback will help improve the application to better fit their needs.

\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}

During the development of this project the project will be maintained by the development team.

\subsection{Formal Specification of Cost Management System}

A critical aspect of this project involves calculating expenses associated to every housemate. In order to represent all costs and expense associated to every housemate in an accurate and timely fashion, we will formally represent this system using Module Interface Specification. \\

Let:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $I$ be the set of all individual items or bills.
    \item $U$ be the set of all users. (Housemates/Roommates etc)
    \item $C$ be the cost associated with each item.
    \item $S$ be a function that maps an item to its sharers.
    \item $P$ be a function that maps an item to its payment division.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Individual Costs}

For each item $i$ in $I$, there is a cost $c$ associated with it. Formally:

\[
C: I \rightarrow R^+
\]

This function $C$ maps every item $i$ to its positive cost $c$.

\subsubsection*{Sharers of Costs}

For each item $i$, there's a subset of users $U_i \subseteq U$ who share its cost. The function $S$ determines which users are responsible for which items:

\[
S: I \rightarrow 2^U
\]

Here, $2^U$ represents the power set of $U$, denoting all possible subsets of users. Not all users necessarily owe an amount.

\subsubsection*{Payment Division}

The function $P$ assigns a portion of the item's cost to each user:

\[
P: I \times U \rightarrow R^+
\]

This means for each item $i$ and user $u$ in $U_i$, $P(i, u)$ returns the amount $u$ owes for $i$. For users not in $U_i$, $P(i, u) = 0$.

\subsubsection*{Constraints}

\subsubsection*{Total Payment}

The total amount paid by all users for an item must equal the cost of that item:

\[
\forall i \in I: \sum_{u \in U} P(i, u) = C(i)
\]

\subsubsection*{Non-negative Payment}

No user can owe a negative amount:

\[
\forall i \in I, \forall u \in U: P(i, u) \geq 0
\]

\subsubsection*{Overall User Expense}

The total amount owed by a user for all items is:

\[
\text{Expense}: U \rightarrow R^+
\]

\[
\text{Expense}(u) = \sum_{i \in I} P(i, u)
\]

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}


\subsection*{Identifying Required Skills}
 What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing, or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at least one item for each team member. \\

Skills
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Project Management: Since this is a large project with a team of 5, good project management skills are required in order to ensure that deliverables are delivered on time.
  \item Presentation Skills: Having good presentation skills will help demonstrate and share the value of our capstone project.
  \item CI/CD: Continuous integration and delivery helps automate the testing process, which helps reduce bugs in code. As such, it is an important skill to learn for this capstone project.  
  \item Mobile Development: The application is being developed for mobile devices, so it is important to learn the tools used in mobile development. 
  \item Database Management: This application will be using a CRUD database to store data. As such, having a good database design will help ensure good performance for the application.
  \item System Design: A good front-end and back-end system design will help ensure the application will meet the requirements listed in this document,
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Acquiring Required Skills}
For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Justin Dang:} For this capstone project the skill I'm really focusing on developing my mobile development skills. This is because I think that mobile development is a really desired skill in the workplace nowadays. To help with this I plan on watching tutorials from the internet about Android development as well as reading some of the documentation on Android and Kotlin in general.
    \item \textbf{Harris Hamid:} This project will involve us to either create a web-app or a mobile app. This involves creating a front-end, back-end system and database to ensure complete functioning of the app. I will be focusing on database design and security issues. I will be brushing up my SQL skills according to the tech-stack we end up using and will be looking into common security issues that mobile and web app usually face in order to mitigate these problems.
    \item \textbf{Fady Morcos:} For this capstone project, I will be focusing on really developing my mobile and graphical interface development skills. This has been something I wanted to master for a long time now. I believe it is very useful to have this skill to allow me to make any creative idea that I have come to life. This would also be a good skill to have has it is very desirable in today's job market. 
    \item \textbf{Rizwan Ahsan:} Since this capstone project requires us to create the application from scratch and to utilize different system design skills to create the front-end and back-end. This will help me develop my elicitation skills for the requirements of the products and also allow to create a better product as a whole. For this I plan on watching various tutorials of system design on the internet and researching various books. This will also benefit us on understanding what tech-stack will be better to utilize or not.
    \item \textbf{Sheikh Afsar:} As we dive into this project, I understand that a key part of this project would be the UI and UX design. I am aiming to go beyond just visuals, prioritizing a user centric approach to ensure our project is simple and intuitive. To help with this goal I want to apply what I learned from my other course "Human Computer Interfaces". I also plan to study UX and technical tools which will help me achieve my goal such as Figma. My goal is also to conduct thorough user research while gathering feedback to refine my design.
\end{itemize}
