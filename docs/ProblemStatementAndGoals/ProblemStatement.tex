\section{Problem Statement}


 %\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
 % \href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
 %{problem statement checklist}.}
% \wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required information.}

\subsection{Problem}

With the ongoing affordable housing shortage in Canada many people have been forced to find roomates in order to have a place to live in. This is especially common at universities like McMaster where its extremely common to have housemates while in student housing. While having roomates may help ease financial pressures it can lead to a lot of stress in dealing with them. These stresses can be things like dealing with splitting household tasks and grocery costs. An application that helps deal with these common stresses in the roomate life would make it more convenient  for the housemates to live together and overall simplify their lives.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\subsection{Stakeholders}

\begin{itemize}
  \item People with housemates: People with housemates are the primary stakeholders of this application. They can use the application to better simplify life with housemates. As such they will have the greatest influence out of the stakeholders on the requirements of the application during the development process.
  \item Landlords: Landlords would be a secondary stakeholder for the application. Landlords might be interested in using an application like this for their tenants so that they will better be able to communicate with them with respects to household tasks that are required. As such, they might play a minor role on determining the requirements of the applicaiton during the design process.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Environment}

The expected environment for this application will  be on mobile devices (e.g. Android/IOS).
