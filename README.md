With the ongoing affordable housing shortage in Canada many people have been forced to find roomates in order to have a place to live in. While having roomates may help ease financial pressures it can lead to a lot of stress in dealing with them. These stresses can be things like dealing with splitting household tasks and grocery costs. Our group wants to create a platform to make it more conveniant for housemates to live together and simplify their lives.

The main features of this platform are:
- A chore management system that allows for the assignment and tracking of weekly/monthly tasks amongst housemates
- A cost management system that allows for costs to split amongst housemates
- A scheduling system that allows for users to schedule events
